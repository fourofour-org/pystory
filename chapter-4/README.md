## Depth of depression builds height of character 

> Point is a huge fan of world leaders who had an impact and who lived their lives for a cause. While reading this quote by Nelson Mandela who spent 27 years behind the bars to get his country free of racism, Point recalls yet another of this man's quote which says: 

## Courage is not the absence of fear but a conquer over it. 

> Point knows that the biggest of our fears are not the ones which we're less probable to come across e.g. "whatever scares you during nights" but rather the real fears are the ones which we carry with us each day. 

> Just for an example, fear of data structures and algorithms or fear of Python or fear of programming in general. 
> As long as we're afraid of something, we can't be friends with that specific thing, be it programming, reading, writing or anything. 
> Point decides overcome his fear of data structures and algorithms. And also he starts discovering his own ways of making data structures and algorithms easy for himself. 

> Meanwhile in the nano world where it's all about space and time. It was about November 2nd, 1988 when a computer worm called Morris Worm [ source wikipedia ] brought down around 6,000 computers. 

> There are vulnerabilities in the nano world, and these vulnerabilities are exploited equally as in the human world. The damage caused by the Morris Worm was in multiples of lacs. Even though the intent behind Morris worm was not harmful as it was just an intellectual activity of a student. 

## The battle of space and time is on 

> Somewhere in the universe right now this battle which is happening on the CPUs and Networks around the world is still on where in some programs are willing while others are loosing. 

> Data structures and algorithms are at the heart of this world because nothing would be possible without them in this world. 
> The story is long but there are more episodes. 

## Let's talk about types in Python 

So how many different data types are supported by Python? 

This seems like a very simple question to which the answer seems as if it's present in mind unless one day we face a situations where we realise oh , I never thought about it. 

It's not the breadth but the depth which is gonna set anything apart whether the human world or the nano world of computer programs. 


### What are different types in Python? 

Numerics: 
    1. Integers 
    2. Floating Point Numbers 
    3. Complex Numbers 

- Floating point numbers are usually implemented using double in C 

- Standard library includes additional numerics:
    fractions.Fraction [ for rationals ]
    decimal.Decimal [ floating points with user definable precision ] 

- For a complex z, z.real and z.imag are floating points representing real and imaginary part 

- Constructors int(), float(), complex() can be used to produce numbers of a specific type 

- Complex > Floating > int 

All common mathematical operations are supported.
