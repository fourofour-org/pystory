It's quite interesting to see what focus can do to a human 
brain. If a human makes up his mind on something and combine 
it with focus then anything is achievable. 

Be it: 
1. Setting up a venture
2. Getting a job at FAANG
3. Becoming the richest man on the earth
4. Buying the most expensive house or car 
5. Travelling the world 
6. Writing a book 

or whatever it is that a person dreams about. 

On reading this Point thinks that he needs to have a master plan to learn Python in the best possible way because without an action plan he's just wasting his precious time and not achieving anything valuable. 

Point thinks of adding the datetime as a skill to his bag

Meanwhile in the nano scale where the battle is all about time and space, it's the time for a revelation. 
These algorithms they know already what's going on in Point's head. There are those who want to help him but there are also those who want to exploit his vulnerabilities

The good algorithms are trying to get Point to his mission i.e. learning Python whereas the bad ones are trying to catch his attention and divert him away form his goals. 

The algorithms are nasty and they don't care much about Point or his vision, all they care about is to ensure they've Point's attention, the more attention they've of Point's time , the more space they have rule over, that's how it works at the nano level. 

These algorithms range from simple onces [ compare to ameoba ] to more complex ones [ compare to humans ]

Yeah the story in pystory is all about these algorithms but for 
now, Point has to learn about dates and times in Python 


## Point to notice from docs: 
> The epoch is the point where the time starts, and is platform dependent. For Unix, the epoch is January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC)

```
import time
start = time.time()

# do some processing 

end = time.time()

total_time = end - start 

print("Time elapsed:" + str(total_time))
# conversion to str because total_time is a float
```

```
# check size of different objects in memory
import sys
def get_size(obj):
    return sys.getsizeof(obj)

# sometimes useful to check size of an object in memory 
# size can be different on different platforms 
```
