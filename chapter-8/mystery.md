# Mystery is all about mystery

For if you knew about it, it would no longer be a `mystery`

The epic battle between the algorithms to win over the world is becoming more and more relevant as the shift is happening from a world driven by mechanic to a world driven by electronics and data. 

Point wants to learn Python so he can get deeper into the instincts of the algrithms and understand this battle at nano scale. 


Python is a language which has its own way of communication. 
It is organised in the sense that you really have no chance of standing with Python if you're not well organised. 

Just for an example, which other language punishes you for being displaced here and there by a space, even Assembly won't mind it [ Mother of C and Grandmother of many ] but Python does have some attitude problems and in Python's dictionary, organised means organised. 

```

t = 12, 2, 'awesome'

if ( t[0] % 2 == 0 ):
    print('first element of tuple is even') # note the 4 spaces 

```

# Declaring a tuple with zero length 

```

# tuple without a length 
t = ()

```

# Declaring a tuple with length 1 

```

# tuple with length 1 

t = 'hello',     

# note the trailing comma, that's what separates a tuple from a string 

```

> Note that whenever you output tuples, you'll always see parenthesis but that's not always the case with input. 


# Unpackng tuple values 

```
t = 12, 2, 'blockchain'

x, y, z = t # note that it's important that tuple is having as many elements as are there on the left side of the expression

```
