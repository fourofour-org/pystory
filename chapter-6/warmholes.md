# All that glitters is not gold.

Most of the times, it's not really gold that has the need to shine but it's usually a trait of non-gold to try to shine. Gold is gold, even if not shining remains gold. 

`Point` is in a deep thought thinking about something. Thinking about finding a best way on the earth to learn Python. Something which is not only enjoyable but also something that sticks forever. 

`Point` realises that all that glitters is not gold. Rather if something glitters, it means we've all the reasons to examine whether it's really what we're thinking of it to be. 

Meanwhile in the `Nano` world where it's all about time and space. There are algorithms who want to bring the power of computer science to the world and then there are algorithms which are only interested in making money for their masters. The battle is not new but the battle field is changing rapidly. 

`Point` knows that he needs to be an expert with Python if he wants to communicate with these algorithms as Python is the one of the warmholes connecting the 2 worlds together. 

 `Point` during his sleep imagines whether he can ever connect the 2 worlds together and live the lives of algorithms and on the other times he's fascinated by the fact that would happen if an algorithm ends up on his planet earth one day. 

 ```
 Python is one of the warmholes which connects the human world to the nano world of super intelligent algorithms 
 ```

 A good knowledge of Python can lead one on an adventure to the nano world where everything happens in nano seconds. 

 Nano = 10 ^ -9 

 which means by the time you read this line, a 10^9 decisions have already been made. 

 ## What fascinates Point about the nano world ? 

 The intelligent algorithms in the nano world are already ruling the minds of humans: 
 1. They're already suggesting them what they should watch
 2. They're already assessing their moods 

 In general, a person is less about their life and the intelligent beings in the nano world are aware of lives of millions and they take decisions for them in nano seconds. 

So in India, Point is learning each and every aspect of Python and that's how he became the man who understands and thinks only in Python. The story which I'm narrating is that of Point. 

Some people think Point has gone crazy, some call him a weird nerd and some think he's just a techy. 

Some believe that point has seen the world which some of us can't imagine about. The first few chapters only started with a brief introduction to the daily routines of Point but we'll go in detail and uncover each aspect of how Python changed Point's life.
